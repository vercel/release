# Release

Release is a command line tool to automatically generate a new [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) and populates it with the changes (commits) made since the last release.

## Usage

Firstly, install the package from [npm](https://npmjs.com/release):

```bash
npm install -g release
```

Alternatively, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to install it:

```bash
yarn global add release
```

Once that's done, you can run this command inside your project's directory:

```bash
release <type>
```

A `<type>` argument can be passed. If you leave it out, a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) will be created from the most recent commit and tag.

According to the [SemVer](https://semver.org) spec, the argument can have one of these values:

-   `major`: Incompatible API changes were introduced
-   `minor`: Functionality was added in a backwards-compatible manner
-   `patch`: Backwards-compatible bug fixes were applied

In addition to those values, we also support creating pre-releases like `3.0.0-canary.1`:

```bash
release pre
```

You can also apply a custom suffix in place of "canary" like this:

```bash
release pre <suffix>
```

Assuming that you provide "beta" as the `<suffix>` your release will then be `3.0.0-beta.1` â€“ and so on...

## Options

The following command will show you a list of all available options:

```bash
release help
```

## Pre-Defining Types

If you want to automate `release` even further, specify the change type of your commits by adding it to the **title** or **description** within parenthesis:

> Error logging works now (patch)

Assuming that you've defined it for a certain commit, `release` won't ask you to set a type for it manually. This will make the process of creating a release even faster.

To pre-define that a commit should be excluded from the list, you can use this keyword:

> This is a commit message (ignore)

## Custom Hook

Sometimes you may want to apply the new version number to a file in the project, or you may want to replace the text in the Github Release.

With a custom hook, the examples above (and many more) are very easy to accomplish:

By default, release will look for a file named `release.js` in the root directory of your project. This file supports two exported functions as hooks:

```js
exports.createTagBefore = async (version) => {
	// For example, modify the version number of the manifest.json of the browser extension
};
exports.createReleaseBefore = async (markdown, metaData) => {
	// Use the available data to create a custom release
	return markdown;
};
```

In the example above, `version` is the version number string to be released, `markdown` contains the release as a `String` (if you just want to replace something). In addition, `metaData` contains these properties:

| Property Name    | Content                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `changeTypes`    | The types of changes and their descriptions           |
| `commits`        | A list of commits since the latest release            |
| `groupedCommits` | Similar to `commits`, but grouped by the change types |
| `authors`        | The GitHub usernames of the release collaborators     |

**Hint1:** You can specify a custom location for the hook file using the `--hook` or `-H` flag, which takes in a path relative to the current working directory.

**Hint2:** The default function exported by the hook file is used as `createReleaseBefore`.

## Why?

As we at [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel) moved all of our GitHub repositories from keeping a `HISTORY.md` file to using [GitHub Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/), we needed a way to automatically generate these releases from our own devices, rather than always having to open a page in the browser and manually add the notes for each change.

## Contributing

You can find the authentication flow [here](https://github.com/vercel/release-auth).

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Uninstall the package if it's already installed: `npm uninstall -g release`
3. Link the package to the global module directory: `npm link`
4. You can now use `release` on the command line!

As always, you can use `npm test` to run the tests and see if your changes have broken anything.

## Credits

Thanks a lot to [Daniel Chatfield](https://github.com/danielchatfield) for donating the "release" name on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [my lovely team](https://vercel.com/about) for telling me about their needs and how I can make this package as efficient as possible.
